This repository contains the code implementing deep learning computer vision techniques for the prediction of crime scene objects.

There are two types of imlementations of this project :
  1.Faster-RCNN model- weapon_detection.py
  2.YOLO V5 model- yolo_v5.py
  
 The major findings of the experimentation of both of the models on our dataset were that :-
  1. Faster-RCNN perferformed better in terms of accuracy producing about 92% mAP score
  2. YOLO V5 performed well in terms on faster training and inferencing speed of about 0.0012s per image
